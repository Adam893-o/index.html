	<h3>A brief history behind planet Jupiter.</h3>
	<p>Jupiter is the 5th planet in the Solar System and was discovered by Astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610. He discovered it using a small telescope that he made all by himself. He came to the conclusion that he discovered Jupiter when he saw that the planet had four moons surrounding it rather than stars. This was a big discovery because people in the west always thought that the Earth was the center of the universe but with Jupiter's discovery, we have finally realized that there are bigger objects out there in our Universe some which may be bigger than anything we've ever dreamed of.</p> 
	<p>Jupiter is the most important planet in our solar system because if it weren't for this Gas Giant. We will not be here. Our solar system is surrounded by an asteroid belt and because Jupiter is located to the center of our planet, This planet uses its strong gravitational pull in and suck any asteroids that come to us and <strong>destroy</strong> them with such powerful gravitational force.</p>
